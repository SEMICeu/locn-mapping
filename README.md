# Purpose and usage

This repository includes documentation and resources concerning a proposal for mapping the relevant terms from the [ISA Core Location Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn) (LOCN) to the [vCard Ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/) (vCard) and to the [Schema.org vocabulary](http://schema.org/) (Schema.org).
    
This work is still a draft. As such, it can be updated any time, and must be considered as unstable.

Comments and queries should be sent to the [ISA Core Location Vocabulary Task Force](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/core_location/):
